##You welcome!

I am a student of Computer Engineering and I focus on web development.

I currently work with NodeJs, ReactJs and Next Js.

Here you can find some repositories containing code that I use to test technologies, learn new things, to keep my notes from classes and some more.

Thanks for visiting and come back soon!!
